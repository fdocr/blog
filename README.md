This is the repository where I'm hosting the source code of my blog. Built using [Metalsmith](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith) with the help of [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) and plenty of other stuff in an attempt to explore and learn something new, cheers.

#### Writing / Development

For writing or local development run `node build.js` and the blog will be built and served on port 5000 with autoreload.

To build the blog for development `node build.js deploy` will do the job. A tiny server can be executed for simple HTTP hosting using `node server.js`.
