First post of just another techie blog, but this one is mine -.-, now let's get started... Tech related stuff here and there with translations to Spanish. The translations won't be literal, but they will be fun to write. I will be trying out random shiny stuff I'm usually interested in and documenting the journey over here. Spoiler alert: **There will be rants**. So braces yourselves, viewer/reader discretion is adviced.

#### Visualcosita

"Stupidest name ever, what the fuck was he thinking? It translates to *Visual thingy* from Spanish... Really?" :rolleyes: The story behind the name lies back to my OS professor in college ( [UCR](http://www.ucr.ac.cr/) <3 ), he was a die hard \*nix advocate that referred to Windows environments as the **dark side**. I never heard him refer to Visual Studio by name and the despise on his tone when calling it "Visual Cosita" is non-translatable nor descriptable (at least not without an impression, sorry guys). So yeah, didn't wanted a blog with my name/nickname(s) and that's the best I was able to come up with, **.xyz** domain because fuck you, that's why.

#### Metalsmith with fries on the side

Finally, something related to tech: I wanted to build a static blog because it just sounds too cool to not give it a try, but mostly because is easy to get the content flowing with some markup. I could've gone by using a more stable/popular project like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), but I wanted to try out something I was going to be able to hack or play around with freely, and I'm **not** a Ruby person. Despite being written in Go, [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) was very tempting not to try out, it has this powerful aura surrounding it. Yet again, learning Go and becoming familiar with the Go environment drove me away right now (more on **me** after this commercial messages from my sponsors).

Now, somewhat close to my web development comfort zone, I was left with a couple thousand PHP and JavaScript (Node JS) static site generators available, tough decision, and the only way to settle it was to test drive a couple of them (I was already kinda biased towards a Node JS project). Long story short, I found [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), and it just felt right as soon as I started putting together a couple of plugins. The ability to personalize a gulp-like pipe (props to [Rob Ribeiro](https://azurelogic.com/posts/building-a-blog-with-metalsmith/) + [Robin Thrift](http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/metalsmith-part-1-setting-up-the-forge/) for awesome tutorials that I highly recommend, and of course all Metalsmith contributors).

The ~~butts~~ buts:

>"Hold your pants right there champ, Node is kilometers behind Go in performance!!" *-A wild metric unit appeared!*

>"Metalsmith who? Jekyll's got 22k stars on github, go home you're drunk"

Well, I'm not looking to take advantage of Go's super strength nor am I inebriated. I'm just sitting here ~~masturbating~~ coding, trying improve my Javascript expertise, struggling to learn something knew every other day and become the **Ultimate Fighting Champion**.

So that's about it for my intro post, I'm an iOS developer (talk about the **dark side**) with lots of curiosity over different technologies ranging from server architecture to web & mobile development. If this blog and the stuff I'll make helps someone, somewhere, somehow... It will be totally worth it. The [blog's source code is on github](https://github.com/fdoxyz/visualcosita.git) so feel free to check it out, feedback is appreciated. I'm in it for the content, expect posts and ~~rants~~ critiques on subjects like Swift/Objective-C/NodeJS/Backend-Environments/etc. Hit me up on [Twitter @fdoxyz](https://twitter.com/fdoxyz) or write a comment below :)
