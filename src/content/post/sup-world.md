So, this will be yet another techie blog. Plain old me, writing about my journey to the depths of hell (Full Stack Development - a.k.a. obsesive curiosity disorder with sparkles of masochism). Before we start I want to state that english is not my primary/native langua... Oh god why, not that clich√© disclaimer again. Nevermind, I had planned to build this website in both English and Spanish from day 1, so the joke's on you! Not that anything I just wrote back there made any sense, but now that you've got an idea of my *definitely not clinically insane* line of thought and *super funny sense of humour*, let's dive into what we came for.

#### Visualcosita

"Stupidest name ever, what the fuck was he thinking? It translates to *Visual thingy* from Spanish? really?" :rolleyes: The story behind the name lies in my OS professor back in college ( [UCR](http://www.ucr.ac.cr/) <3 ), he was an old school \*nix advocate that referred to Windows environments as the **dark side**. I never heard him refer to Visual Studio by name, the despise felt on his tone when calling it "Visual Cosita" is non-translatable nor descriptable without an impression, sorry guys. So yeah, didn't wanted a blog with my name/nickname(s) and that's the best I was able to come up with; **.xyz** domain because fuck you, that's why.

#### Metalsmith with fries on the side

Finally, something related to tech. I wanted to build a static blog because it just sounds too cool to not give it a try. I could've gone by using a more stable/popular project like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), but I wanted to try out something I was going to be able to hack or play around with freely, so ruby was not the answer for me. Despite being written in Go, [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) was very tempting not to try out, it has this powerful aura surrounding it. Yet again, learning Go and becoming familiar with the Go environment drove me away at this moment of my life (more on **me** after this commercial brake from my sponsors).

Now, somewhat near my web development comfort zone, I was left with a couple thousand PHP and Javascript (NodeJS) static site generators available, tough decision, and the only way was to take on test drives a couple of them (I was already pretty sure a Node based project was going to be the one, it is what I believe has more future potential and wanted to build expertise there). Finally [Metalsmith](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith) was the answer, it just felt right when starting to put a couple of plugins together and the ability to personalize a gulp-like pipe (props to [Rob Ribeiro](https://azurelogic.com/posts/building-a-blog-with-metalsmith/), [Robin Thrift](http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/metalsmith-part-1-setting-up-the-forge/) for awesome tutorials that I recommend and the contributors to the Metalsmith project).

Hold your pants right there, Node is kilometers behind Go in performance!! (don't feel intimidated by that metric unit, it's just a centimeter \* 100,000, and an inch is 2.54 centimeters, how many feet/miles would that be? I'll let you guys do the easy arithmetics left). And besides, Metalsmith who? *Jekyll's got 22k stars on github, go home you're drunk*. Well, I'm not looking to take advantage of Go's super strength nor am I drunk, and by attempting to improve my Javascript Kung Fu, a language that I can use in back-end & front-end (oldest excuse ever, but still valid IMHO) I guess that would be alright, as long as it's fun and useful on the long run.

So that's about it for my intro post, I'm an iOS developer (talk about the **dark side**) with lots of curiosity over different technologies ranging from server architecture to web & mobile development. I hope I'll learn a thing or two by doing this and if it helps someone, somewhere, somehow... It will be totally worth it. The [blog's source code is on github](https://github.com/fdoxyz/visualcosita.git) so feel free to check it out, feedback is appreciated. I'm in it for the content, I will attempt to write about Swift/Objective-C/NodeJS/Backend-Environments and what I'll learn along the way.

***PS:*** The Spanish version I was talking about is important for me, but it's on hold right now, while I find a nice/classy way (and time) to implement the translations with Metalsmith.
