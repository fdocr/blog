I was actually talking to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, didn&#39;t see you standing there. Oh well, I fancy being watched anyways, let&#39;s get started.</p>

<p>Metalsmith who? It&#39;s awesome, even though I keep hearing in the back of my head <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>, <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, etc. But why go static in the first place? I&#39;m not serving huge amounts of traffic (yet); the only answer I can make up right now is that I want to play around with the tool <strong><em>-no pun intented-</em></strong> and not just using it. That means that JavaScript or PHP were my first options since I&#39;m <strong>not</strong> a ruby person, nor am I eager to learn Go or yet another language. After a couple of test drives I found Metalsmith, and just putting together a couple of plugins felt right. Props to <a href="https://azurelogic.com/posts/building-a-blog-with-metalsmith/">Rob Ribeiro</a> + <a href="http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/metalsmith-part-1-setting-up-the-forge/">Robin Thrift</a> for awesome tutorials that I highly recommend to get started with Metalsmith, and of course all Metalsmith contributors.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed most of this site generator was the gulp-like pipe strategy for chaining your process. Also its awesome how easy you can write your own plugin to handle any crazy idea you can come up with. In the <a href="/post/metalsmith-polyglot">next post</a> I&#39;ll write about the plugin I made to help me translate this blog and a couple of tricks I used.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an iOS Developer, but curious about lots of different technologies. I also enjoy tearing everything apart and putting it back together to learn how it works. Expect posts about Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript, Docker, and anything else that gets in my way. Hope this might be of any help for someone, somewhere, somehow... That would make it totally worth it.</p>
<p>One small thing I&#39;d like to point out, now that I&#39;ve finally started writing something other than code, now I see its not that easy to translate as I had planned (specially jokes), let&#39;s just hope the writing get&#39;s better with time... I promise I&#39;ll keep puns to where they are absolutely necessary.</p>
