I'm a software engineer working as an independent contractor. Currently based in [Costa Rica](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Costa+Rica/@16.9000066,-95.0553076,4.55z), working as a solutions architect & full stack developer. I graduated from [UCR](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/) as a B.A.Sc. in Computer Science (2014) and from [UPC BarcelonaTech](https://www.upc.edu/en) with a Masters in Informatics Engineering (2016).

I've been recently focused on backend & full-stack web development. Previously led iOS native projects, starting from (re) design stage all the way to release and support post launch. I survived a few of the early Swift major version upgrades and lived to tell the story.

 * Ruby on Rails
