It's difficult to explain what this website is about sometimes. The best description I've come up with lives down in the footer. So for the [About](/about) page I'll be talking about myself instead.

I'm an independent contractor based in Costa Rica currently working as a solutions architect & full stack developer.

As for experience I've been recently focused on backend & full-stack web development. I've also led the development of iOS native projects, starting from (re) design stage all the way to release and support post launch. I lived to tell the story after upgrading a few of the early Swift major versions.

Throughout my career I've had experience working with the following technologies:

 * Ruby on Rails
    * Currently very interested in [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org/) for minimal frontend Javascript
    * Experience with API only backends
 * (Ruby) Gem publishing
    * [Martilla](https://github.com/fdoxyz/martilla)
    * [lecli](https://rubygems.org/gems/lecli)
    * [activek8s](https://rubygems.org/gems/activek8s)
 * Experience with multiple cloud providers
    * AWS
    * Azure
    * DigitalOcean
    * Heroku
 * CI/CD Pipelines
    * CircleCI
    * Drone
    * Travis CI
    * AWS CodePipeline
 * Docker
 * [Kubernetes]({% post_url 2018-09-14-aks-easy-as-abc %})

    * Worked with both Swift & Objective-C
